CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) â€” A half-eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich found at the scene led Wyoming police to arrest a burglary suspect.
The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports (http://bit.ly/2hZsgUt ) that Zachery Munoz has pleaded not guilty to three counts of burglary.
Cheyenne police say someone on three separate occasions in September stole power tools and equipment from a business. In the first case, police say they found a half-eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich at the scene. They dubbed the suspect the "PB&J burglar."
Police say subsequent DNA testing done at the Wyoming State Crime Lab linked 26-year-old Munoz to the sandwich.
He entered a plea earlier this month, and his trial is scheduled for February.
